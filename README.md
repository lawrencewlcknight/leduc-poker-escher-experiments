# Leduc Poker ESCHER Experiments

This repository contains reproducible experiments for evaluating ESCHER-style neural counterfactual regret minimisation on Leduc poker using DeepMind's OpenSpiel library.

The immediate aim is to establish a thesis-quality ESCHER baseline that is aligned with the sister Deep CFR repository. Leduc poker is used as the diagnostic environment because it is a small two-player zero-sum imperfect-information game with a known game value and exact exploitability evaluation. The results from this repository are intended to sit alongside the Deep CFR Leduc poker experiments in an MPhil thesis on neural CFR methods for poker.

The repository is organised so that each experiment can be run independently while sharing reusable ESCHER code. The shared `escher_poker` package contains the ESCHER solver, neural-network definitions, reservoir replay buffer, plotting helpers, seeding utilities, and experiment export utilities. Each experiment lives in its own package under `experiments/leduc_poker/<experiment_name>/`.

## Experiments

### 1. Leduc poker ESCHER multi-seed baseline

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_multiseed_baseline/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_multiseed_baseline/README.md)

Runs the aligned ESCHER baseline on OpenSpiel `leduc_poker` across the same ten random seeds used in the Deep CFR baseline experiments. The default solver specification is deliberately lightweight for Leduc poker, using smaller 64-by-64 networks, fewer traversals, fewer supervised training steps, and less frequent intermediate exploitability checks than the original notebook-aligned configuration. The primary metric is exploitability, reported as NashConv divided by two. Secondary metrics include policy-value error from the known Leduc game value, nodes touched, wall-clock time, and final/best/final-window exploitability. Diagnostic metrics include average-policy loss, regret-network losses, history-value-network train/test loss, and replay-buffer sizes.

**Question:** under a fixed training protocol, does the ESCHER implementation learn a low-exploitability average policy in Leduc poker, and how variable is the result across random seeds?

### 2. ESCHER intermediate average-policy training ablation

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_intermediate_policy_training_ablation/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_intermediate_policy_training_ablation/README.md)

Compares the baseline ESCHER diagnostic protocol against final-only average-policy extraction. In the baseline, each intermediate exploitability checkpoint trains a playable average-policy network from average-policy memory. The ablation asks whether those repeated supervised policy-network training events affect final exploitability, or whether they are mainly an evaluation cost.

**Question:** does disabling intermediate policy-network training change final ESCHER performance, once the regret/history-value training configuration and seeds are held fixed?

The experiment has three arms: the baseline intermediate-checkpoint regime, final-only policy training with the usual single-event budget, and final-only policy training with the baseline's total policy-gradient budget matched at final extraction.

### 3. ESCHER checkpoint-stability head-to-head experiment

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_checkpoint_stability/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_checkpoint_stability/README.md)

Saves playable average-policy checkpoints during ESCHER training and evaluates whether later checkpoints consistently beat earlier checkpoints in exact head-to-head play. The experiment also supports a continuous-baseline arm so the checkpoint/resume mechanism can be checked against a single uninterrupted ESCHER run.

**Question:** as ESCHER training progresses, do later average-policy checkpoints become stronger than earlier checkpoints, or is checkpoint quality non-monotonic?

### 4. ESCHER constrained hyperparameter search

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_constrained_hyperparameter_search/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_constrained_hyperparameter_search/README.md)

Runs a bounded search around the ESCHER baseline configuration to test whether poor convergence in Leduc poker can be explained by avoidable optimisation or approximation settings. The experiment uses a screening stage over baseline, targeted, and random candidates, then confirms the strongest candidates against the baseline under matched seeds. The default search space is capped around the lightweight baseline so it tests smaller and moderately larger specifications without returning to the old notebook-scale budgets.

**Question:** can a constrained change to ESCHER hyperparameters produce reliably lower exploitability than the thesis baseline?

### 5. ESCHER warm-start fair ablation

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_warm_start_fair_ablation/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_warm_start_fair_ablation/README.md)

Runs paired continuous and checkpoint/resume ESCHER arms to test whether interrupting training, saving the full solver state, loading it into a fresh solver, and continuing changes final policy quality. The warm-start boundary defaults to iteration 30, matching the staged exploratory workflow.

**Question:** does checkpoint/resume behaviour introduce an unintended confound relative to an uninterrupted ESCHER baseline with the same headline training budget?

### 6. ESCHER learning-rate schedule ablation

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_lr_schedule_ablation/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_lr_schedule_ablation/README.md)

Compares the constant-learning-rate ESCHER baseline against a decaying learning-rate schedule under matched seeds and matched training budgets. The default scheduled arm uses cosine decay from the baseline learning rate to 10% of that value.

**Question:** can learning-rate decay stabilise ESCHER's value/regret optimisation enough to reduce exploitability relative to the constant-learning-rate baseline?

### 7. ESCHER average-policy reach-weighting ablation

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_reach_weighting_ablation/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_reach_weighting_ablation/README.md)

Compares the baseline average-policy regression loss, weighted by CFR iteration only, against a treatment that also weights samples by the acting player's reach probability. Reach multipliers are mean-normalised within each policy-training batch and exclude chance reach.

**Question:** does reach-probability weighting improve the learned average policy produced from ESCHER's average-policy memory?

### 8. ESCHER value-trajectory reuse ablation

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_reuse_value_trajectory_ablation/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_reuse_value_trajectory_ablation/README.md)

Compares the baseline ESCHER value-data collection scheme, which uses a dedicated history-value traversal pass, against a treatment that reuses player-0 regret traversals to populate the history-value memory. The treatment keeps value-test traversals for diagnostics but removes the dedicated value-training traversal pass.

**Question:** can ESCHER reduce traversal cost by reusing regret trajectories for value training without degrading the learned average policy?

### 9. ESCHER disk-backed regret-memory ablation

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_disk_backed_regret_memory_ablation/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_disk_backed_regret_memory_ablation/README.md)

Compares the standard in-memory regret replay buffers against a disk-backed TFRecord regret replay backend streamed during regret-network training. Average-policy replay is disk-backed in both arms so the treatment isolates regret-memory storage.

**Question:** can ESCHER reduce regret replay RAM pressure with disk-backed TFRecord shards while preserving strategic performance?

### 10. ESCHER on-policy joint-regret ablation

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_on_policy_joint_regret_ablation/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_on_policy_joint_regret_ablation/README.md)

Compares the baseline separate player-specific regret traversal batches against an on-policy joint-regret update variant. The treatment samples one trajectory batch from the current joint regret-matching policy and writes regret targets for the acting player at each visited decision node.

**Question:** can ESCHER reduce regret-data generation work by collecting on-policy joint regret samples without degrading the learned average policy?

### 11. ESCHER solver-parameter random search

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_solver_parameter_random_search/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_solver_parameter_random_search/README.md)

Runs a bounded two-stage random search over configurable ESCHER solver parameters. Screening evaluates the baseline plus sampled solver configurations under a reduced budget; confirmation compares the strongest sampled configurations against the ESCHER baseline with matched seeds and the full baseline budget. The sampled ranges include lightweight and modestly heavier candidates while excluding configurations likely to make multi-seed training time explode.

**Question:** is ESCHER's Leduc poker non-convergence partly caused by a poor balance between traversal budget, value fitting, regret fitting, policy extraction, exploration, and network capacity?

### 12. ESCHER diagnostic hypothesis sweep

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_diagnostic_hypothesis_sweep/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_diagnostic_hypothesis_sweep/README.md)

Runs a quick single-seed diagnostic sweep over the leading ESCHER exploitability
hypotheses: disabling importance sampling, using uniform zero-regret fallback,
skipping intermediate average-policy extraction, and increasing to a larger
author-style Leduc budget. This experiment is meant for fast insight rather than
thesis-grade multi-seed confirmation.

**Question:** which suspected implementation or parameterisation issue most directly explains ESCHER's poor exploitability convergence?

### 13. ESCHER author-budget multi-seed validation

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_author_budget_multiseed/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_author_budget_multiseed/README.md)

Runs the best-performing Experiment 12 configuration for 80 ESCHER iterations
over five seeds. This uses the author-style Leduc budget, disables importance
sampling in regret targets, and uses a uniform legal-action zero-regret fallback.

**Question:** does the best single-seed diagnostic configuration retain its
lower exploitability when run for the full baseline iteration budget over a
small multi-seed validation set?

### 14. ESCHER network-size sweep

[`experiments/leduc_poker/escher_network_size_sweep/`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_network_size_sweep/README.md)

Runs a single-seed sweep over policy, regret, and history-value network
architectures while keeping the Experiment 13 training protocol fixed. The sweep
tests small, lightweight, reference, wider, and deeper multilayer perceptrons.

**Question:** how sensitive is the revised ESCHER configuration to hidden-layer
width and depth?

### 15-22. ESCHER architecture diagnostic sweeps

These single-seed diagnostic experiments extend Experiment 14 by isolating
specific neural-network design choices under the Experiment 13 training budget:

- [`escher_separate_network_architecture_sweep`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_separate_network_architecture_sweep/README.md) varies relative capacity across the policy, regret, and value networks.
- [`escher_regret_network_width_sweep`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_regret_network_width_sweep/README.md) varies regret-network width while holding the other networks fixed.
- [`escher_policy_network_width_sweep`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_policy_network_width_sweep/README.md) varies average-policy-network width while holding the other networks fixed.
- [`escher_layer_norm_ablation`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_layer_norm_ablation/README.md) tests whether layer normalisation helps or hurts each network.
- [`escher_activation_sweep`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_activation_sweep/README.md) compares LeakyReLU, ReLU, ELU, GELU, Swish, and Tanh.
- [`escher_residual_mlp_sweep`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_residual_mlp_sweep/README.md) compares plain MLPs, same-width residual blocks, and projection residual blocks.
- [`escher_bottleneck_architecture_sweep`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_bottleneck_architecture_sweep/README.md) compares bottleneck, non-bottleneck, wide, and expanding MLP shapes.
- [`escher_shared_trunk_head_sweep`](experiments/leduc_poker/escher_shared_trunk_head_sweep/README.md) compares the current shared trunk plus linear action-output layer with separate per-action heads.

**Question:** which network-design choices most improve ESCHER's exploitability
convergence once the stronger Experiment 13 training protocol is fixed?

## Setup

Create and activate a Python 3.9 virtual environment. The repository contains
a placeholder `venv/` directory, but the actual environment is not committed.

```bash
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows PowerShell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

OpenSpiel installation can vary by platform. If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails on `open_spiel`, install OpenSpiel following the official instructions for your platform.

Outputs are written to a timestamped subdirectory under `outputs/` by default. The key files are:

Average-policy-value charts plot the configured `average_policy_value_target`.
For Leduc poker this is player 0's Nash equilibrium value, approximately
`-0.085606424078`; future games should override that config value rather than
editing plotting code.

Full `outputs/` directories are scratch working data and are gitignored. Curated
lightweight thesis-facing results can be promoted into the tracked
`thesis_artifacts/` tree with [docs/THESIS_ARTIFACTS.md](docs/THESIS_ARTIFACTS.md).

Ablation experiments also export variant-level and paired-comparison files such as:

## Notes for adding future experiments

When adding a new ESCHER experiment, follow the same pattern as the baseline:

1. create a new folder under `experiments/leduc_poker/`;
2. include a `config.py`, `run.py`, and `README.md`;
3. hold the baseline protocol fixed except for the intended treatment variable;
4. use matched seeds where possible;
5. export the same core metrics and plots so the thesis results have consistent look and feel.
6. put reusable seed runners, metrics, and plotting helpers in `escher_poker` when they will likely apply to more than one experiment.
